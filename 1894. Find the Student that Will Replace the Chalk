/*
LOGIC---
//binary search on answer 
=> prefixsum sorted array, remainingchalk target, nature: YYYYYYYNNNNN, return first N

Why first N? => return l => where the condition fails first time
The binary search logic should return the first index where the remainingchalk is less than prefix[mid]. If the remainingchalk is equal to or greater than prefix[mid], you need to search the right half. If it’s less, you should search the left half.

Why ans!=mid?
We can't set ans to the index where the remainingchalk is greater than or equal to prefix[mid]. However, we want to return the first index where the remaining chalk runs out, which is the first prefix[i] that exceeds remainingchalk.
That's why we return first N, or rather first failed l. So, when binary search fails return l.

O(n+ logn) is better than O(2n).

/*
LOGIC----
Event his is not the optimised approach. We know that the chalk array is not sorted and accoridng to problem we can't sort it.
But how we progress and move forward each time, we search for index where we need new chalk
Search index => search algorithm => BINARY SEARCH
sorted array => can be expressed as prefix sum => sorted nature
use this to find the correct index

/*
LOGIC---
The reason I say its brute force, is becuase the TC- O(k) as it loops k times in worst case on array. and constraint wise => 1 <= k <= 10^9

So, its bad, in fact you can stop looping k times on array, if you can directly find at once how many times you loop on array. 
This can be done by knowing the final sum of array.
