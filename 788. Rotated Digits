/*
LOGIC---
Representation encoding:
dp[i] = 0, invalid number
dp[i] = 1, valid and same number
dp[i] = 2, valid and different number

The idea is to split the current processing number into 2 sub-numbers which have already been processed, the way used here is to split the number (say x digits) into x-1 digit number and 1-digit number, it actually doesn't matter on where to split number, you can totally split the number evenly in the mid and the result should still be the same.
eg: Once it gets to 100, all 2 digits result are already available in dp[]. Just need to consider the addition digit.
Case i: dp[a]==0 || dp[b]==0 => one of them invalid will make the whole number invalid
Now if dp[a]==dp[b]==1 => invalid when they will be put together since same number will come out

APPROACH---
We can fill the dp for single numbers.
Now how to go for double numbers without calculating again.
Like 11 => break it into two parts
a=1(rest of number), b=1(last digit of number)
Now a and b would already be precalculated in dp.
So, we can directly return.

In case of bigger number like 111112, you won't have to iterarte over the whole number again.
a=11111 and b=2 would already be calculated in dp table.
dp[11111]=1 and dp[2]=2
so, our number is valid.


WHY DP?
The point is to reduce calculating the same sub problems.
In brute force, e.g. N=112, you need to judge digit by digit for N=1 to 112. time complexity: O(N * #digits)
And the same pattern like 11 is actually re-calculated because you already traversed N=11, and know it's a valid and same pattern, but you judge it again when you meet N=112.

In DP, N=112 is separated into 2 sub-problems, N=11 and N=2, and since these two patterns have already been caculated, we can get the answer for 112 directly. 

The simple point is we don't want to iterate each number again and again like in brute force but use precalculated answers.

time complexity: O(N) 
space complexity: O(N)
Though, in this problem, the execution time for DP is not faster than brute force, but in theorem it's faster.


How to ocme up with this solution:
n=abcdef
One of ways to identify if it can be rotated and be valdi si to iterate and check all the indivudal digits.
if one of them is rotateable and changes without any invalid number will make number good.
Infact the validity of number is indivudally calculated through digits.
So, if the number contaisn no invalid number, and a is rotatebale and valid, so will be ab, abc and abd and so on wil make it valid.

/*
LOGIC---
Having 3,4,7 -> will make it invalid.
Having 0,1,8 only -> the rotation will keep the same number -> invalid
you need to have atleast one occurence of 2,5,6,9 -> valid
