LOGIC---
Case I: If num == 0, then empty set valid, return 0.

1234= 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4 
    = 10^3 + 2x10^2 + 3x10^1 + 4 
    = 10^3 + (10^2 + 10^2) + (10 + 10 + 10) + 4 
    -> notice how only 4 is actually what we are concerned the rest are just 10's
    
=> hence, you only need to look at the last digit.

Reason:
The series that we will be using to construct sum is in fact:
eg: k=2 : 2,12,22,32,42,....
its of form: k, k+10, k+10+10, k+10+10+10,.... and so on
-> again its just the number k and rest are multiple of 10

So, we can say 
sum = a*k + some arbitrary multiple of 10

Where when a is multiplied by k, its last digit and the las tdigit of sum should be same.

eg:
sum=58, k=9
We need to rewrite the number sum in form of sum = a*k + some multiple of 10
Hence the last digit of multiple of 9 must be equal to the last digit of 58.

And we do have 2*9=18
58 = 2*9 + 40
Now, the number 40 there are multiple ways to make it multiples of 10 like (0, 40), (10,30), (20,20). 
Then you can add it into your (9, 9) to achieve (9,49) (19, 39), (29, 29).

That means the correct size of our set which we need is infact the frequency of k without which the sum would become a multiple of 10.

APPROACH---
Example [58 9] , we take 58 - 9 = 49 , then 49 - 9 = 40
now we can add 40 in tens place or hundreds place anywhere as we want
we can do 39 19 or 49 9 or 29 29

DERIVED TWO IMPORTANT CONDITION:
last digit of a*k = last digit of sum => (size*k)%10 == sum%10 : VALIDITY CHECK
when to stop or rather reached the minimum size(freq) : size*k <= sum : OPTIMAL ANSWER CHECK
where, size is basically our answer or number a or the frequency of k.

Apply these two conditions in a loop of size existing ebtween range [1,10].

Finally why do we have range of 1  to 10?
Say you've got k = 1, and your num's unit digit is 0 (say num = 10). In this case, you'll need 10 numbers with a unit digit of 1. This is an extreme example, and if you think about it, for the rest of the cases, the set size will be less than or equal to 10. 

SOME MATHS PROOF---
Assume the size of the set is n, and the numbers in the set are A1, A2,..., An
A1 + A2 + ... + An = sum
All numbers must have k as the unit digit
So A1 + A2 + ... + An = n*k + 10*(a1 + a2 + .. + an) = sum
Which (a1 + a2 + .. + an) can be any number.
For example:
sum = 58, k = 9 => we have n*k = 2*9 = 18, and 10*(a1 + a2) = 58 - 18 = 40. So a1 + a2 = 4
Just find the minimum number satisfying the condition (n*k)%10==sum%10, because 10*(a1 + a2 + .. + an)%10 allways equal to 0

/*
LOGIC---
Why DP? 
Observe the series and imagine how take and not_take options works.

The series from which we can choose number from is:
k, 1k, 2k, 3k,.....
so its basically 10+k each time

So, just apply take not_take logic to the above series and find which can be made into sum.

Take the minimum of both for answer and take a high value which would imply that we wont be able to make sum.

Some base cases:
Case I: If num == 0, then empty set valid, return 0.
Case II: sum is odd and unit digit is even => return -1 will fial to make sum
