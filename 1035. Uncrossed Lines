Uncrossed Lines II ❌Greedy - Recursion - Memo - DP - DP Optimized || LCS Variation (LONGES COMMON SUBSEQUENCE
While understanding this article readi it from bottom code

/* DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BEATS 100% */
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length, m = nums2.length;
        if (n < m) return maxUncrossedLines(nums2, nums1);
        int[] dp = new int[m + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            int prev = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++){
                int curr = dp[j];
                if(nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]) dp[j] = prev + 1;
                else dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j-1], curr);
                prev = curr;
            }
        }
        return dp[m];
    }
}

LOGIC -
Why are we solving it with dp is becuase we have a repeating subproblem
Consider at a point we are having i and j in each array at same index, now we have a choice to either move i or j just as we saw in the recursion.
But at one point we will again alnd on the next index where i and j position will be same and we have again a choice to either move i or j. Use dynamic programming
Also, a memorization recursion can never be optimised. We have to conver the same solution to tabular method or bottom up approach


/* RECURSION + MEMORIZATION => ACCEPTED */
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int dp[][] = new int[nums1.length+1][nums2.length+1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums1.length; i++) {            //can also do this : for (int[] row : dp) {Arrays.fill(row, -1);}
            for (int j = 0; j <= nums2.length; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1;  // Initialize dp array with -1
            }
        }
        return solve(0, 0, nums1, nums2, dp);       //i and j initialised as 0
    }

    public int solve(int i, int j, int[]nums1, int[]nums2, int dp[][]){
        if(i==nums1.length || j==nums2.length) return 0;    //if any of the one reaches the end we have reached the solution
        if(dp[i][j]!=-1) return dp[i][j];           //checking if already calculated
        int count=0;
        if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]){ 
            count= 1 + solve(i+1, j+1, nums1, nums2, dp);   //we got a match so take both i and j and move to next one
        }
        else{
            count+=Math.max(solve(i+1,j,nums1,nums2,dp), solve(i,j+1,nums1,nums2,dp));
        }
        return dp[i][j]=count;  //storing value in dp and returning count
    }
}

LOGIC --- How memorisation is working
We make a dp matrix array and intialise its content by -1.
Each time we calculate count we put it inside dp[i][j].
Now if the dp[i][j] is not equal to -1, that emnas we have already calculated it and don't need to calculate it again.
TC - O(n*m) -> We have every combination of i and j
SC - O(n*m) -> size of dp

Hence, we have avoided the situation of calculating something more than once


/* RECURSIVE SOLUTION - TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED */
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        return solve(0, 0, nums1, nums2);       //i and j initialised as 0
    }

    public int solve(int i, int j, int[]nums1, int[]nums2){
        if(i==nums1.length || j==nums2.length) return 0;
        int count=0;
        if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]){ 
            count= 1 + solve(i+1, j+1, nums1, nums2);   //we got a match so take both i and j and move to next one
        }
        else{
            count+=Math.max(solve(i+1,j,nums1,nums2), solve(i,j+1,nums1,nums2));
        }
        return count;
    }
}

LOGIC --- RECURSION
Case I : nums1[i]==nums2[j] then, counter++
Case II : else ---- two subcases -> leave one of them -> (leave i or leave j)
To, overcome TLE we will use MEMORIZATION


⭐⭐⭐ IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐
NOTE --- ❌Greedy - ✅Recursion (DP)===> to get all cases and choose the maximum one

/* A FAILED APPROACH */  ====> VERDICT THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE SOLVED BY GREEDY BUT DP ===> SAME SITUATION IN LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE THERE ALSO DO DP AND NOT GREEDY
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int count=0;
        int ans=0;
        int flag=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums1.length;i++){
            flag=0;
            for(int j=count; (j<nums2.length && flag==0); j++){
                if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]){
                    count=j+1;
                    ans++;
                    flag=1;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

THE REASON IT FAILS BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT RETURN THE MAXIMUM BUT ONLY THE FIRST KIND, SIMILAR TO GREEDY.
Input
nums1 =
[1,1,2,1,2]
nums2 =
[1,3,2,3,1]
Use Testcase
Output
2   ==> YOU ONLY GET THIS BY CONSIDERING THE FIRST GREEDY CASE

Expected
3   ===> THIS IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE


So, greedy won't work
Becuase, at every step we have an option to consider it or not -(something like a tree with two branches - recursion) - take it or leave it
