LOGIC---
Observation---- (DECODING THE GIVEN EXPRESSION TRICK)
SCORE = nums[i] * (j-i) 
On carefully thinking what the expression does is ----
j-i would imply nums[i] contributing from index i to j

Say, a1,a2,a3,a4,a5
So, let's say you want to move from i=1 to i=4
So, score = a[i]*(j-i)
So, it can be also read as a[i] works as a contribution score from range i to j as you move
In fact, you could have made a jump of 1 each time then 
score = a1[2-1] + a2[3-2] + a3[4-3] + a4[5-4] => notice last element contribution is never taken
score = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4

But if a2<a1 or something like this, then we can't say its going to make max contribution.
in fact we could have taken a1 from 1 to 3 directly and say instead of a2 let a1 contribute from 1 to 3.
So, we say don't let a2 amke the contribution from 2 to 3, let a1 do it instead.

And let's ay now a3>a1, so we can take a3 and discard a1 as contributor and from 3 onwards a3 will be the score contributor.

APPROACH---
Moving from 1 to n-1 or rahter say 0 to n-2 => the element that should contribute to the score to make it maximum should be the maximum element till i.
We are just replacing the number at current index with the maximum number we have seen till now.

Why this greedy?
Infact from i to j => we have mutliple options to choose for our score contributor ranging from [ai to aj-1] => so the best contributor at each point will be the max till then.

HOW TO DO IT WITH DP -> CONVEX HULL OPTIMISATION
dp[i] -> score made travelling from i to n
Let'ss ay in between you deicded to jump form i to jj to reach n
dp[i] = dp[j] + (j-i)*nums[i] => where, dp[j] would contain the maximum score to reach from j to n

In fact we need to maximise dp[i]

max(dp[i]) = max(dp[j] + j*nums[i]) + constant(i*nums[i])

So, we need max(dp[j] + j*nums[i]) => equaltion of a line kind of something

So, the above falls under Convex Hull Optimization 1
