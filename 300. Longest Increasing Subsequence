Since in code we use prev=-1;
In dp states use dp[curr][prev+1] to avoid array out of bound. you can do it without as well if you put if checks commented in code.

Space complexity: O(n^2) for the memoization table.

/*
EXAMPLE---
Consider the example nums = [2, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 1].
let's try to build the increasing subsequences starting with an empty one: sub1 = [].
=> Let pick the first element, sub1 = [2].
=> 6 is greater than previous number, sub1 = [2, 6]
=> 8 is greater than previous number, sub1 = [2, 6, 8]
=> 3 is less than previous number, we can't extend the subsequence sub1, but we must keep 3 because in the future there may have the longest subsequence start with [2, 3], sub1 = [2, 6, 8], sub2 = [2, 3].
    
=> With 4, we can't extend sub1, but we can extend sub2, so sub1 = [2, 6, 8], sub2 = [2, 3, 4].
=> With 5, we can't extend sub1, but we can extend sub2, so sub1 = [2, 6, 8], sub2 = [2, 3, 4, 5].
=> With 1, we can't extend neither sub1 nor sub2, but we need to keep 1, so sub1=[2,6,8], sub2=[2,3,4,5], sub3=[1].

Finally, length of longest increase subsequence = len(sub2) = 4.


OBSERVATION---
we need to keep different sub arrays (sub1, sub2..., subk) which causes poor performance. But we notice that we can just keep one sub array, when new number x is not greater than the last element of the subsequence sub, we do binary search to find the smallest element >= x in sub, and replace with number x.

EXAMPLE---
Let's run that example nums = [2, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 1] again:
=> Let pick the first element, sub = [2].
=> 6 is greater than previous number, sub = [2, 6]
=> 8 is greater than previous number, sub = [2, 6, 8]
=> 3 is less than previous number, so we can't extend the subsequence sub. We need to find the smallest number >= 3 in sub, it's 6. Then we overwrite it, now sub = [2, 3, 8].
=> 4 is less than previous number, so we can't extend the subsequence sub. We overwrite 8 by 4, so sub = [2, 3, 4].
=> 5 is greater than previous number, sub = [2, 3, 4, 5].
=> 1 is less than previous number, so we can't extend the subsequence sub. We overwrite 2 by 1, so sub = [1, 3, 4, 5].

Finally, length of longest increase subsequence = len(sub) = 4.

WHY BINARY SEARCH WORKS--- 
For those wondering why BS works, here's a rundown for ya:
Basically we keep extending the sequence long as we keep finding increasing elements. Soon as we find a smaller element, we replace it, emphasis on the word REPLACE . Replacing doesnt change the length, meaning that our longest length is kept intact, but the order of the elements get changed. Hence, we get the correct length, but not to correct LIS.

Note  :sub wont be the correct LIS it would jsut be the correct size of LIS.

/*
LOGIC---
Apply take and not_take logic.

Take will be initiated only when nums[curr]>nums[prev] => increasing subsequence
or when prev == -1: This indicates that no element has been selected so far, meaning the current element (nums[curr]) can be freely chosen to start a new subsequence.

Update prev and curr accordingly.
